Mutations in the LMNA gene have been found to cause multiple disorders, collectively known as A-type laminopathies, that have overlapping signs and symptoms (23853504, 20074070, OMIM, 16364671).   A-type laminopathies include familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2, also called familial partial lipodystrophy, Dunnigan type), Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B1 disease, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Heart-hand syndrome, Slovenian type, mandibuloacral dysplasia, Malouf syndrome, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy (23853504, 20074070, OMIM).  To date, no clear genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified (23853504, 20074070).  The c.1445G>A variant has been identified in multiple individuals over multiple generations in families with clinical diagnoses of FPLD2 (22700598, 10868844, 10999845, 10587585, 10739751, 10655060).  This variant was also found in the homozygous state in an individual with FPLD2 and autosomal recessive-EDMD (23313286).  A different amino acid change at codon 482, Arg482Trp, has also been shown to segregate with FPLD2 (23853504, 22700598, 10999845, 10739751, 10655060). Approximately 75% of patients with FPLD2 have a mutation at Arg482, making it a mutational hotspot for FPLD2 (16364671).  Multiple lines of computational evidence (SIFT, LRT, MutationTaster, FATHMM, MetaSVM, MetalR, GERP, CADD) predict the c.1445G>A variant is probably damaging to the protein structure, function, or protein-protein interaction. Indeed, functional studies of the Arg482Gln mutant protein, as well as the Arg482Trp protein, demonstrated a failure of adipocyte cell differentiation (16415042). A transgenic mouse harboring the Arg482Gln mutation recapitulates the FPLD2 phenotype and studies confirmed a lack of adipocyte renewal (19201734)."

This variant is predicted to cause a frameshift, which alters the proteinês amino acid sequence beginning at position 596 and leads to a premature termination codon 111 amino acids downstream.

In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Cys18Arg variant may slightly impact protein function, resulting in moderately decreased binding activity to the insulin promoter and decreased transcription of insulin in response to hyperglycemia  (PMID: 30930126, 10545530). However, these types of assays may not accurately represent biological function. Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. The p.Cys18Arg variant did not segregate with type 2 diabetes mellitus in 3 affected relatives of  individuals with the variant, suggesting that this variant is not pathogenic for type 2 diabetes mellitus (PMID: 10545530). The variant is located in a region of PDX1 that is important for protein binding, suggesting that this variant is in a functional domain and slighly supports pathogenicity (PMID: 27879214).
