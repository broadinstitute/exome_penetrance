The variant was also found in a heterozygous state in at least two unaffected family members of patients (Henderson et al. 1991; Dichek et al. 1991; Santer et al. 2005; Nierman et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007; Ooi et al. 2011; Rabacchi et al. 2015; Rodrigues et al. 2016; Tani et al. 2016).

This frequency is based on only one allele in a region of good coverage so the variant is presumed to be rare. Functional studies demonstrated that despite finding the variant protein in the culture medium, the variant protein had virtually no lipolytic activity. Further, the amount of intracellular variant LPL protein was found to be higher than wild-type and it is suggested that the variant protein may not be secreted appropriately (Henderson et al. 1991).

This variant has also been identified in at least 7 Caucasian individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (Gudnason 1993, Callis 1998, Fouchier 2001, Bertolini 2013, Sharifi 2016) and has been reported in ClinVar (Variation ID 3690). Additionally, in vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Asp227Glu variant may impair receptor activity (Fourie 1988). This variant has been identified in 1/33548 Latino chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs121908028). This frequency is low enough to be consistent with the frequency of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in the general population.

The variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 5,600 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. G18R variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function.

Mutation taster predicts a disease-causing outcome for this variant. While Human Splicing Finder predicts this variant to form a cryptic splice acceptor site, other four splice prediction tools predict no significant impact on normal splicing. Functional study shows that this variant leads to aberrant splicing, resulting in a 7-bp addition, a 20-bp deletion, or 30-bp deletion of exon 32 that encodes NBF-2 (nucleotide binding fold 2) of the protein (Thomas_1995). This variant was found in 373/164074 control chromosomes including ExAC at a frequency of 0.0022734, which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic ABCC8 variant (0.0033541). This variant is a known common pathogenic variant causing congenital hyperinsulinism (CH). In Ashkenazi population, c.39899G>A and p.F1387del are the two most common CH-associated ABCC8 mutations (Nestorowicz_1998, Glaser_2011). Carrier rate of this mutation in Ashkenazi general population is 1:60 (Glaser_2011). In GeneReviews, proportion of familial CH attributed to these two mutations is estimated to be nearly 45%.

It has been shown that the C-terminal tail of the receptor contains a signal for cell surface expression, hence any truncation of the protein upstream of this signal as is predicted for the p.Tyr35Ter variant would result in intracellular retention of the variant receptor (MacKenzie, 2006).

The S127L variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The S127L variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which occurs within the Transmembrane 3 domain at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. A missense variant in a nearby residue (D126Y) has been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with obesity (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.

The p.Phe639Leu variant occurs in alternate transcript NM_005572.3 (lamin C) which corresponds to position c.1698+13C>A in NM_170707.3, that is the primary transcript listed in the Methods. This variant is present in population databases (rs80338938, ExAC 0.2%). This variant has been reported to segregate with dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction defects in a large multigenerational family (PMID: 10580070). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 14485). A different variant (c.1711_1712delinsTC ) giving rise to the same protein effect observed here (p.Arg571Ser) has been reported in an individual affected with뙄뿾 lipodystrophy (PMID: 28686329), indicating that this residue may be critical for protein function. A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg571Cys) has been reported in an individual affected with muscular dystrophy and peripheral neuropathy (PMID: 15965218). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease.

R527H has not been reported in association with a cardiomyopathy phenotype to our knowledge, and to date, heterozygous carriers of the R527H variant have not been reported to exhibit disease phenotype. However, R527H has been observed at GeneDx in the heterozygous state, in the absence of other pathogenic variants, in one individual diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. The R527H variant is observed in 6/30986 (0.02%) alleles from individuals of Latino ancestry in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The R527H variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. Functional studies using fibroblasts from homozygous R527H MAD patients demonstrated that R527H results in an accumulation of unprocessed prelamin A, alters distribution of the lamin B receptor, and destabilizes two heterochromatin-associated proteins (Filesi et al., 2005). Finally, several missense variants in the same residue (R527C, R527L, R527P) have been reported in association with laminopathies (Cao et al., 2003; Scharner et al., 2013; Zwerger et al., 2013), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.

This variant has been reported to segregate with autosomal recessive mandibuloacral dysplasia in several families and has been reported in the homozygous state in multiple affected individuals (PMID: 12075506, 14627682). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 14499).

The p.Ser573Leu variant has also been identified by our laboratory in 1 teenager with infantile DCM and 1 adult with HCM; however, the teenager also carried a likely pathogenic variant in another gene (LMM unpublished data). It has also been identified in 9/57438 European chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation consortium (ExAC, http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs60890628). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein.

The valine residue is highly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between valine and methionine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been observed on the opposite chromosome (in trans) from a pathogenic variant in an individual affected with mandibuloacral dysplasia (PMID: 17848409). This finding is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and suggests that this variant contributes to disease. This variant has also been reported in the heterozygous state in an individual affected with dilated cardiomyopathy (PMID: 19875404) and in the compound heterozygous state in an individual affected with a severe form of familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) (PMID: 10999845). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 14520). Experimental studies have found that cell lines carrying this missense change in the compound heterozygous state display altered nuclear morphology and heterochromatin organization (PMID: 17848409). A yeast two-hybrid screen has found that this missense change leads to a decrease in the number of LMNA interaction partners, but the functional significance of this observation is not known (PMID: 24623722). In summary, this variant has been observed in individuals affected with multiple different LMNA-associated disorders and experimental data suggest that it may impact LMNA protein function.

Four of these patients had a very early age at onset (range birth to 7 years) and no family history, which is atypical for LMNA variants. The p.Arg644Cys variant has also been identified in a large number of individuals (>20) with a diverse range of clinical features consistent with laminopathy, isolated cardiomyopathy (DCM, ARVC, HCM) or Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with clinical overlap with some laminopathies (Speckman 2000, Genschel 2001, Csoka 2004, Mercuri 2005, Muntoni 2006, Rankin 2008, Pasotti 2008, Perrot 2009, M믗ller 2009, Larsen 2011, Kortum 2011, Scharner 2011, Quarta 2012, Vasli 2012, Hoyer 2014).

Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein; however, in vitro functional studies indicate the variant may affect nuclear morphology (Csoka 2004).

The R644C variant has been identified in individuals with isolated cardiomyopathy, laminopathies, Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, or Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, and also in asymptomatic relatives. Additionally, two studies reported that the R644C variant did not segregate with disease in two unrelated families (Mercuri et al., 2005; Muntoni et al., 2006). The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) reports R644C was observed in 106/63,724 alleles from individuals of Non-Finnish European and 27/16,410 alleles from individuals of South Asian ancestry, including one homozygote, indicating it may be a rare benign variant in these populations (Lek et al., 2016). It has been suggested that the extreme phenotypic variability caused by this pleiotropic LMNA variant could be due to either an altered methylation pattern or abnormal post-translational processing of prelamin A because R644C is located at the C-terminal end of lamin A/C close to the endoproteolytic cleavage site (Perrot et al., 2009; Capell et al., 2006). The R644C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Additionally, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals. Nevertheless, in silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function.",not specified,CN169374:not specified,Mentions  laminopathies,FALSE,NA,FALSE,"criteria provided, single submitter",clinical testing,germline:na,GeneDx,SCV000234713.8,LMNA,-,"Lipodystrophy, MonogenicDM_all",11/21/18,49960,0,260,"[0.9973979183346677,0.002602081665332266]",256

This variant was found in 145/117680 control chromosomes (1 homozygote) at a frequency of 0.0012322, which is approximately 5 times the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic LMNA variant causing cardiomyopathy (0.00025), suggesting this variant is possibly a benign polymorphism. This variant has been reported in multiple patients with a variety of phenotypes, including lipodystrophy, diabetes, distal motor neuropathy, DCM, scoliosis, hepatic steatosis. Many unaffected relatives of these patients also carry the variant of interest, suggesting this variant has low penetrance or is not associated with phenotype (Cann_2017, Genschel_2000, Rankin_2008, Muntoni_2006, Vasli_2012). Arg644 is located close to ZMPSTE24 cleavage site (codon 646-647) and one study showed that R644C may affect the cleavage efficiency by ZMPSTE24 (Barrowman_2012). Another functional study showed that although this variant did not significantly affect the levels of nuclear abnormalities, it did result in a potential loss of cellular compartmentalization as evidenced by a significant increase in non-lethal ruptures of the nuclear envelope relative to the wild-type LMNA protein (De Vos_2011). However, the results and conclusions drawn from this study are not directly correlated to the mechanisms and presentation of disease associated with Laminopathies attributed to LMNA variants. In addition, multiple clinical diagnostic laboratories/reputable databases provided conflicting classifications including likely pathogenic, VUS, and likely benign. Taken together, this variant is classified as VUS for cardiomyopathy, however, its pathogenicity causing other phenotype with low penetrance can not be ruled out.",MedGen:CN221809,CN517202:not provided,Pubmed articles mention cardiac and Emery Dreifuss,FALSE,Wrong phenotype,FALSE,"criteria provided, single submitter",clinical testing,germline:na,Integrated Genetics/Laboratory Corporation of America,SCV000699968.1,LMNA,-,"Lipodystrophy, MonogenicDM_all",11/21/18,49960,0,260,"[0.9973979183346677,0.002602081665332266]",256

The arginine residue is moderately conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between arginine and glutamine. This variant is present in population databases (rs5742904, ExAC 0.04%). This variant is a very well known cause of hypercholesterolemia due to APOB deficiency mainly in people of European ancestry (PMID: 24404629). It has been reported to segregate in families affected with hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 2563166, 21868016) and has been reported in multiple affected unrelated individuals (PMID: 9105560, 21059979, 18325181, 18222178, 10388479, 23375686). This variant is also known in the literature as p.Arg3500Gln. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 17890). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disturbs the APOB protein conformation preventing it from binding LDL, therefore disturbing its normal function as inhibitor of the LDL receptor (PMID: 11115503, 15797858). A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg3527Trp) is reported to be deleterious (PMID: 7627691). This indicates that the arginine residue is important for APOB protein function.

The disorder caused by this specific variant is sometimes referred as hypercholesterolemia, due to ligand-defective apo B [MIM 144010].

In-silico splice prediction models predict that c.361 A>G may create a cryptic splice donor site in exon 4 that could supplant the natural splice donor site. However, in the absence of RNA/functional studies, the actual effect of the c.361 A>G change in this individual is unknown. If c.361 A>G does not alter splicing, it will result in the S121G missense change. The S121G variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function.

However, the variant was also reported in multiple unaffected family members as well as unaffected controls in these studies. The P33T variant was not observed in approximately 5400 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The P33T variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. While functional studies have indicated that P33T impairs the normal function of the PDX1 protein, this impairment is not complete (Gragnoli et al., 2005).

Other clinical laboratories have also reported this variant in ClinVar (Variation ID 36453). In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Glu408Lys variant may impact ligand recycling as it failed to release ligands in the endosome (Hobbs 1992, Strom 2011). This variant has also been identified in 2/111530 European chromosomes by the Genome Aggregation Database (GnomAD, http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs137943601). This frequency is low enough to be consistent with the frequency of FH in the general population. Additionally, other amino acid changes at this position have been reported in individuals with FH (Palcoux 2008, Duscova 2011), suggesting that changes at this position may not be tolerated.

Hobbs et al. (1992) originally reported V827I in an American individual with homozygous FH, who also harbored a second variant in the LDLR gene. Lombardi et al. (2000) identified this variant in a cohort of individuals with FH from the Netherlands but did not provided detailed clinical information. The V827I variant was also identified in a 36-year-old Russian female with FH (LDL-C 321 mg/dl) (Zakharova et al., 2005). Vandrocova et al. (2013) identified V827I in a middle-aged proband with elevated total cholesterol (7.9 mmol/l), but also in the proband's adult daughter with normal cholesterol levels (4.6 mmol/l). More recently, V827I was found in 8 Israeli individuals (7 heterozygotes and 1 compound heterozygote) with a mean cholesterol level of 5.4 mmol/L (Durst et al., 2017). Study participants were also genotyped for 6 common LDL-C raising SNPs, and 6/8 V827I carriers had a 6-SNP score above the top quartile cutoff, suggesting that V827I alone is not sufficient to cause the full FH phenotype (Durst et al., 2017). Via whole exome sequencing, Do et al. (2015) identified V287I in 4 patients experiencing myocardial infarction (MI) at an early age, as well as in 5 control individuals with no history of MI. There are conflicting classifications of V827I in ClinVar by other clinical laboratories, ranging from benign to likely pathogenic (SCV000503493.1, SCV000556789.1, SCV000540872.1, SCV000052790.2, SCV000484685.1, SCV000583958.1; Landrum et al., 2016). The V827I variant is observed in approximately 169/10,152 alleles (1.6%) from individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, indicating it may be a rare benign variant in this population. The V827I variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. However, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function.",not specified,CN169374:not specified,FH,TRUE,NA,TRUE,"criteria provided, single submitter",clinical testing,germline:na,GeneDx,SCV000521002.3,LDLR,-,High LDL,11/2/17,49959,1,16,"[0.9998398686923277,1.6013130767229128E-4]",16

This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals. Functional studies demonstrated the R3500W variant reduced APOB capacity for binding, uptake and degradation of LDL (Fisher et al., 1999). Furthermore, a different missense variant affecting the same residue (R3527Q) has been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with an APOB-related disorder (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.

This frequency is low enough to be consistent with the frequency of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in the general population.

Additionally, another variant at this position, p.Arg3527Gln, is a well-established pathogenic variant for FH. In summary, this variant meets criteria to be classified as pathogenic for FH in an autosomal dominant manner based upon segregation studies, increased prevalence in affected individuals, and pathogenicity of other variants at this position.

The G523R variant is observed in 7/38,488 alleles (0.02%) from individuals of non-Finnish European background in the ExAC dataset with no homozygous controls reported (Lek et al., 2016). The G523R variant results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. In addition, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species, and in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. A study of protein interaction found that G523R altered the ability of LMNA to interact with 5% of its targets, though the clinical validity of this observation was not established (Dittmer et al., 2014). Missense variants in nearby residues (W520R, W520G, W520S, R527C, R527P, R527L, and R527H) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with LMNA-related disorders (Stenson et al., 2014), supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Nonetheless, the G523R variant has been classified as a variant of uncertain significance by other clinical laboratories in ClinVar, one of which reports this variant was observed in two individuals with DCM who also harbored an additional likely pathogenic variant (SCV000065017.4, SCV000320458.1, SCV000336479.1; Landrum et al., 2016). In summary, this variant lacks observation in a sufficient number of affected individuals, segregation data, and functional evidence, all of which would further clarify pathogenicity.

The S326T variant in LMNA gene has been reported previously in association with Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and was absent from 100 healthy controls (Muntoni F et al., 2006). This individuals family history was positive for molecularly confirmed X-linked EDMD, however as the proband was severely affected additional studies identified a de novo S326T sequence change in LMNA gene. The authors hypothezised that separate mutations in related proteins that interact or are involved in the same pathway, may contribute to disease severity in EDMD (Muntoni F et al., 2006). On the other hand, a simulation model used for structural and thermodynamic characterization of LMNA mutations showed that S326T did not affect noticeably the coil 2B dimerization of lamin A/C (Gangemi F et al., 2012). The S326T variant was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Missense mutations in nearby residues (E317K, A318T, R331Q, R331P, S334N, R335Q, R335W, R336Q) have been reported in association with LMNA-related disorder, supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. However, the S326T variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is not well conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant likely does not alter the protein structure/function. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant.

Furthermore, algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, Align-GVGD) all suggest that this variant is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies. In summary, this variant is a rare missense change that is not predicted to affect protein function. It has been reported in both the population and affected individuals, but the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine its role in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.",MedGen:CN043576,"C0270914:Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2",NA,FALSE,Wrong phenotype,FALSE,"criteria provided, single submitter",clinical testing,germline:na,Invitae,SCV000657831.3,LMNA,-,"Lipodystrophy, MonogenicDM_all",11/21/18,49960,0,5,"[0.9999499599679744,5.004003202562049E-5]",5

This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function.

The R545H variant in the LMNA gene was previously identified in one patient in a cohort of LMNA variant carriers who had known cardiac involvement or a family history of cardiac involvement (van Rijsingen et al., 2013). This variant has also been reported in a patient with lipodystrophy (Chan et al., 2016). Additionally, this variant has been reported in several individuals at GeneDx with various levels of cardiac involvement. The R545H variant is observed in 38/75898 (0.05%) alleles from individuals of European (non-Finnish) ancestry in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The R545H variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, and in silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. Nevertheless, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved among mammals and is located within the C-terminal tail domain. A variant in the same residue (R545C) has been reported in association with muscular dystrophy (Kandert et al., 2009). Additionally, missense variants in nearby residues (R541C, R541H, R541G) have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database in association with LMNA-related disorders (Stenson et al., 2014), further supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.",Not Provided,CN517202:not provided,lipodystrophy,TRUE,NA,FALSE,"criteria provided, single submitter",clinical testing,germline:na,GeneDx,SCV000234709.3,LMNA,-,"Lipodystrophy, MonogenicDM_all",4/23/18,49960,0,39,"[0.9996096877502002,3.9031224979983986E-4]",39

Additionally a functional study of LDLR function in fibroblast monolayers revealed the variant to only have the WT 15-30% LDL receptor activity suggesting the variant to be a partially transport defective allele that impairs transport between ER and Golgi. Furthermore, the variat was found not to fold into a unique disulphide bond structure like the WT does, thus leading to the conclusion that this variant gives rise to a protein folding defect.

This variant is present in population databases (rs730882109, ExAC 0.09%), and has an allele count higher than expected for a pathogenic variant (PMID: 28166811).

Subsequently, an individual with elevated LDL-C was found to harbor this variant in isolation (Wang et al., 2016). The R469W variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. Nevertheless, this substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved across species, where W469 is wild-type in at least one mammalian species. Additionally, the majority of in silico analyses (2 out of 3) predict this variant likely does not alter the protein structure/function. Though R469W was presumed to be a gain-of-function variant by Hampton et al. (2007), in vitro functional analysis showed no effect on the ability of the PCSK9-encoded protein to bind Annexin A2, a protein responsible for inhibiting PCSK9-endoded protein activity (Ly et al,. 2014). Therefore, the mechanism by which this variant may result in disease is unclear. Furthermore, the Exome Aggregation Consortium reports R469W was observed in 80/10392 (0.8%) alleles from individuals of African background, including two individuals of African background who were homozygous for the variant.

The variant is present in the control population dataset of ExAC at frequency of 0.021%. The observed frequency does not exceed the maximum expected allele frequency for a pathogenic LDLR variant of 0.1%, suggesting that it is not a common polymorphism. In addtion, it is unknown whether the control population was cardiographically evaluated or profiled for lipid levels. Therefore, they may or may not represent as true normal population with respect to the silent phenotypes associated with this gene. This variant was found in several affected individuals with premature atherosclerosis and/or hypercholesterolaemia but without strong evidence for casualty.

The cysteine residue is highly conserved and there is a large physicochemical difference between cysteine and tyrosine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has been reported in the literature in multiples individuals affected with familial hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 9259195, 19837725, 17142622, 10559517, 16250003). This variant is also known as p.Cys68Tyr in the literature. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 226312). This variant affects a cysteine residue located within an LDLRA domain of the LDLR protein. Cysteine residues in these domains have been shown to be involved in the formation of disulfide bridges, which are critical for protein structure and stability (PMID: 7548065, 7603991, 7979249). In addition, missense substitutions within the LDLRA domains affecting cysteine residues are overrepresented among patients with hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 18325082). Different missense substitutions at this codon (p.Cys89Trp, p.Cys89Arg, p.Cys89Gly) have been observed in individuals affected with familial hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 9974426,뙄뿾10208479, 21868016, 15241806, 20809525). This suggests that the cysteine residue is critical for LDLR protein function and that other missense substitutions at this position may also be deleterious. In summary, this variant is a rare missense change that has been reported in multiple affected individuals and it is located in a residue important for protein function.

Functional analyses show that this variant results into NMD causing absent LDLR protein (Charng_2006) and/or extremely low LDL receptor activity (Hobbs_1992).

One in silico tool predicts a disease-causing outcome for this variant. 5/5 splice prediction tools predict the creation of a cryptic splice site 8bp upstream of the canonical splice site at the exon-intron junction. A functional study that assayed splicing defects via cDNA analysis in a family affected by familial hypercholesterolemia showed that a heterozygous individual expresses both the WT allele as well as the variant allele (which includes the 8bp of retained intronic sequence), and a severely affected homozygous individual who expresses no detectable WT transcript (Sun_Sci Rep_2015). Additionally, another study analyzed residual LDLR activity in B- and T-lymphocytes in FH patients compared to control individuals and found that heterozygous patients have approximately half of LDLR activity of control individuals via flow cytometry experiments (Romano_JLR_2011), which supports the hypothesis that the variant is a null allele. This variant was found in the large control database ExAC at a frequency of 0.0000417 (5/119944 control chromosomes), which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic LDLR variant (0.0012508). In addition, the observations of the variant in the ExAC dataset needs to be cautiously considered due to the cohort containing individuals that could harbor a LDLR phenotype. Furthermore, a publication, Sun_2015, shows the variant to cosegregate with disease in a large FH family, including the proband, who was homozygous for the variant and had a significantly elevated lipid level.

A different missense substitution at this codon (p.Arg633Cys) is reported to be deleterious (PMID: 9259195, 15241806, 23375686). This variant is also known in the literature as R612C. This indicates that the arginine residue is important for LDLR protein function. In summary, this is a rare missense change that has been reported in patients affected with hypercholesterolemia and is located in a residue important for LDLR protein function.

This variant has been reported in several individuals affected with familial hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 11462246, 11933210, 25461735, 25962062, 22353362, 20538126, 16250003, 26343872, 27206935). This variant is also known as p.Arg236Trp in the literature. This variant is reportedly found on the same allele as LDLR p.Asp589Asn (PMID: 16250003, 18325082). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 251446). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change does not show significant functional differences in LDLR activity, in contrast to established disease-causing variants (PMID: 25545329). In summary, this variant is a rare missense change that is not predicted to affect protein function. It has been reported in both the population and affected individuals, but the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine its role in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.",MedGen:C0020445,C0745103:Familial hypercholesterolemia,NA,TRUE,NA,TRUE,"criteria provided, single submitter",clinical testing,germline:na,Invitae,SCV000544695.3,LDLR,-,High LDL,6/29/18,49960,0,1,"[0.9999899919935948,1.00080064051241E-5]",1

The variant has been reported in affected inviduals in the literature, without strong evidence for causality, including co-occurrence data and co-segregation data. Two independent functional studies reveal that this variant results in a molecular gain-of-function, i.e. enhanced LDLR binding to PCSK9. This increased affinity of PCSK9 to the LDLR would in turn lead to enhanced LDLR destruction, decreased plasma LDL-C clearance, and hypercholesterolemia.

One functional study has shown that the variant causes two aberrant splicing transcripts in several heterozygous patient cell lines and that the variant segregates with disease within two families, although several family members are discordant. This study also showed that LDL receptor was not properly trafficked to the cell surface in transfected COS7 cells (Jensen_CG_1999). However, a second functional study also detected aberrant splicing, but assessed LDL receptor protein function in heterozygous patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines and found that ~75% or greater of LDLR was at the cell surface and LDL was internalized similarly to controls, suggesting the variant transcripts do not have a significant biological impact (Holla_MGM_2009). Additionally, several studies have cited the variant in hypercholesterolemia patients, though cosegregation data is lacking in most cases. Based on the literature data, the variant may represent a mild mutation and may have a potentiated effect in compound heterozygosity with a truly pathogenic mutation, but have a less severe impact in heterozygous patients. This variant was found in the large control database ExAC at a frequency of 0.000034 (4/117662 control chromosomes), which does not exceed the estimated maximal expected allele frequency of a pathogenic LDLR variant (0.0010005).

The authors also reported that the levels of LDL-cholesterol in homozygotes and double heterozygotes of the p.Glu32Lys variant were significantly higher (p<0.001) than p.Glu32Lys heterozygotes, which were in turn significantly higher (p<0.001) than in unaffected family members. In addition, the variant was shown to segregate with a phenotype of elevated LDL-cholesterol levels by Mabuchi et al. (2014) and Noguchi et al. (2010) in unrelated families, although the phenotype was milder than that of heterozygotes with a mutation in the LDLR gene. Control data are unavailable for the p.Glu32Lys variant, which is reported at a frequency of 0.00155 in the East Asian population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium but this is based on two alleles only and hence the variant is presumed rare.

The variant was also shown to have impaired ligand-stimulated ERK 1/2 activation, a partial cAMP response when stimulated with alpha-MSH, and to exhibit a 17-fold decrease in affinity to NDP-MSH as a result of a markedly reduced ligand binding capacity (Nijenhuis et al. 2003; Yeo et al. 2003; He et al. 2014).

Furthermore, this variant was identified homozygously or in compound heterozygosity in multiple diazoxide-unresponsive comprehensively genotyped neonatal patients with biochemically and histologically confirmed diagnosed diffuse CHI which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Although no in-vitro functional studies supporting a loss of function of the ATP regulated potassium channels have been reported, the available patient characteristics provide in-vivo evidence demonstrating a damaging effect of this variant on channel function. Taken together, the ascertained evidence has been weighted to classify this variant as Pathogenic.",MedGen:C3888018,C3888018:Familial hyperinsulinism,NA,FALSE,Wrong phenotype,FALSE,"criteria provided, single submitter",clinical testing,germline:na,Integrated Genetics/Laboratory Corporation of America,SCV000696592.1,ABCC8,-,"MODY Extended, MonogenicDM_all, Neonatal Diabetes",3/11/17,49960,0,3,"[0.9999699759807846,3.0024019215372297E-5]",3
